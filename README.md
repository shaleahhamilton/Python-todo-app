# Python To-Do List App (Beginner Project)

This is my first Python project — a command-line to-do list application I built while learning the basics of programming.

### ✅ Features
- Add tasks
- View tasks
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks to a file
- Load tasks when program starts

### 🧠 Concepts I learned:
- `print()` for output
- `input()` for user interaction
- Variables and lists
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if / elif / else`)
- File reading and writing (`open`, `.write`, `.read`)
- Basic error handling and debugging

### ▶️ How to Run
1. Install Python (if you don’t have it)
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the folder
3. Run:
